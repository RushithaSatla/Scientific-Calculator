# Scientific Calculator - Python (Tkinter)

This project is a Scientific Calculator application developed in Python using the Tkinter library. The calculator provides standard and scientific functionalities, supporting various mathematical operations and functions such as basic arithmetic, trigonometry, logarithmic functions, and more. 

# Features

The Scientific Calculator supports a range of mathematical operations, including:

- Basic Arithmetic: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Trigonometric Functions: Sine, cosine, tangent, and their hyperbolic equivalents.
- Logarithmic Functions: log, log10, log2, and exp.
- Constants: π (pi), e (Euler’s number), and τ (tau).
- Square Root and Exponentiation: Square root, exponential functions, and powers.
- Advanced Functions: Inverse trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, gamma functions, and degree-radian conversions.
  
The calculator features a simple and responsive graphical user interface (GUI) created with Tkinter, designed to be intuitive and easy to use.

# Installation

1. Clone the Repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/scientific-calculator-tkinter.git
   cd scientific-calculator-tkinter
   

2. Run the Calculator:
   Execute the Python file to start the calculator:
   bash
   Scientific_Calculator.py
   

# Usage

- Launch the Calculator: Run the `Scientific_Calculator.py` file to open the GUI calculator window.
- Enter Values: Use the number pad and operator buttons to perform calculations.
- Scientific Functions: Access advanced functions like trigonometry, logarithmic operations, and constants by clicking the respective buttons.

Example Calculations

1. Addition: Press numbers and `+` to add, then `=` for results.
2. Trigonometry: Input an angle, then select `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, etc.
3. Logarithms: Input a number and select `log`, `log10`, or `exp` for logarithmic calculations.

# Dependencies

The project uses only the Tkinter library, which is included with Python by default. No additional libraries are needed.

# Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error or the calculator does not display correctly, check the following:
- Ensure Python is installed correctly and updated to a version that supports Tkinter.
- Verify that all code dependencies are satisfied (Tkinter is built into Python standard installations).
